# Personal Portfolio - Terminal Style

Welcome to my personal portfolio, a creative digital space crafted to resemble a terminal interface. It is inspired by the innovative project [LiveTerm](https://github.com/Cveinnt/LiveTerm), and I've added my own twist to it.

## Overview

This portfolio is an interactive way to explore my work, skills, and projects. Designed to emulate the look and feel of a real terminal, users can navigate through the content by typing commands, just like in a real shell environment.

## Features

- **Terminal-like Interaction**: Users can input commands to navigate the portfolio.
- **Fetchsum Command**: A special command `fetchsum` is implemented to quickly fetch a summary of my professional profile.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensuring a seamless experience across all devices.

## Commands

- `fetchsum`: Retrieves a summary of my professional experiences, personal projects, and skills.
- `help`: Lists all the available commands within the terminal portfolio.
- `clear`: Clears the current terminal screen.
- `about`: Displays information about my background and interests.
- `projects`: Provides a list of my personal and academic projects with descriptions.
- `contact`: Shows how to get in touch with me for collaborations or inquiries.

## How to Use

1. Open the portfolio terminal.
2. Type `help` for a list of available commands.
3. Use `fetchsum` to get a quick summary.
4. Explore other commands to learn more about my work and skills.

## Technical Details

- **Frontend**: The interface is built using modern web technologies and follows the design patterns of a Unix-like terminal.
- **Fetchsum Implementation**: A custom script is used to serve the summary information, utilizing server-side rendering for optimal performance.
- **Inspiration**: This project is based on the open-source template from [LiveTerm](https://github.com/Cveinnt/LiveTerm), with significant modifications and personal touches to suit my portfolio needs.
